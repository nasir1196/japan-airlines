                    such disclosure;<br />
                    · To help investigate, prevent or take action regarding unlawful and illegal activities,
                    suspected fraud, potential threat to the safety or security of any person, violations of
                    usbanglaairlines.com terms of use or to defend against legal claims;<br />
                    We have your permission to provide products or services you’ve requested. We reserve
                    the right to disclose your personal identifiable and email address information as required
                    by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or

                    We share your information with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. The security of
                    your personal information and email address is important to us. When you enter
                    sensitive information (such as credit / debit card number) on our acquiring bank’s
                    system or order forms, they encrypt that information using secure socket layer
                    technology (SSL).<br />

                    email address submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No
                    method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure,
                    however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                    personal information and email address, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you
                    have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at bestairlinesbd@gmail.com
