                            <p>Youngest flight in South Asia
                                Immediately after the independence, Biman Bangladesh Airlines started its journey on 4th January 1972 with
                                a DC-3 aircraft. After procuring two F-27s, Biman finally took-off on 7th March 1972 with domestic flights
                                to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base at Dhaka. Shortly after, a Boeing 707 aircraft joined the airlineâ€™s
                                fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. By end of the Seventies, Biman had a fleet of 8 F27
                                and 5 Boeing 707 to serve domestic and international destinations.</p>
                            <p>The Eighties was the new era of building Biman fleet with new Fokker 28-4000 in 1981, wide-bodied three
                                DC10-30s joined in 1983, one new DC10-30 joined in 1989. In early 1990, Biman phased out its aging F27 and
                                purchased two new ATPs to serve domestic and some regional destinations. In 1996 Biman also purchased two
                                new Airbus 310-300 from Airbus Company and phased out its ATPs in 2004.</p>
